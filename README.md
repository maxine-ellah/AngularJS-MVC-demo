# MVC and AngularJS campus talk

_An intro to AngularJS framework and overview of MVC design pattern._

While at Dev Academy I chose to give a talk and code demo on AngularJS to my class. It was a framework I had never worked with but having a good understanding of JS fundamentals helped me get the hang of it quickly. Since it is a framework which uses the MVC design pattern, something which hadn't been covered in a lot of depth on the course, I decided to talk about that too, to provide some context.
